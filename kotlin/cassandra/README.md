# Connecting Kotlin and Apache Cassandra with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Cassandra instance running, skip the steps to run Cassandra in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Cassandra

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1. Start a Cassandra instance:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name cassandra -p 9042:9042 cassandra:latest
   ```

1. Wait for Cassandra to accept connections. This can take a minute or two:

   ```sh
   docker exec cassandra cqlsh -e "DESCRIBE CLUSTER"
   ```

   If the command fails, wait a few seconds and run it again.

### Connect to Cassandra

1. Install the Cassandra ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --pre cassandra
   ```

1. Customize the `main` function in `Main.kt`
   - Change the connection arguments in `params`
     - Format `uri` according to the [driver documentation](https://docs.adbc-drivers.org/drivers/cassandra/index.html#connecting), or keep it as is

1. Run the Kotlin program:

   ```sh
   gradle run
   ```

### Clean up

1. Stop the Docker container running Cassandra:

   ```sh
   docker stop cassandra
   ```
