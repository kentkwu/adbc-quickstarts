# Connecting JavaScript and MotherDuck with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Create a MotherDuck account](https://motherduck.com/)

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
   - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. (Optional) Create an access token in MotherDuck and save it as the environment variable `motherduck_token` as described at [Authenticating to MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/authenticating-to-motherduck/#authentication-using-an-access-token). If you skip this step, a browser window will open each time you connect, asking you to log in or confirm access.

### Connect to MotherDuck

1. Install the DuckDB ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install duckdb
   ```

1. Install dependencies from the `javascript/` directory:

   ```sh
   cd ../..
   npm install
   cd duckdb/motherduck
   ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
   - Change the `path` in `databaseOptions` to the name of a MotherDuck database (prefixed with `md:`), or keep it set to `md:sample_data` to use MotherDuck's sample data
   - Change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()` to query the tables in your database

1. Run the script:

   **Node.js:**

   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```

   **Bun:**

   ```sh
   bun run main.js
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If MotherDuck reports that you are not using a compatible DuckDB version, you can install the specific version it requires by running:
> ```sh
> dbc install "duckdb=X.Y.Z"
> ```
