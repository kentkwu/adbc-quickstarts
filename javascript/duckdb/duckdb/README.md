# Connecting JavaScript and DuckDB with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
   - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/)
   - On macOS, if you have Homebrew installed, run `brew install duckdb`

### Connect to DuckDB

1. Install the DuckDB ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install duckdb
   ```

1. Install dependencies from the `javascript/` directory:

   ```sh
   cd ..
   npm install
   cd duckdb
   ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
   - Change the `path` in `databaseOptions` to the location of the DuckDB database file you want to query, or keep it set to `games.duckdb` to use the database file included with this example
   - If you changed the database file, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()`
